Having a bit of fun with code challenge posted on Ayende's blog

I kinda like the C# solution, besides:

- writing both lower and upper limit when defining an interval - makes an interval self contained, but when setting up the calculator it seems redundant.
- the algorithm actually runs through all intervals even though it would be possible to determine earlier whether we should stop.
- i guess you could add some interfaces to make the code easier to re-use elsewhere, but right now it would be overkill.

Ruby solution:
- very primitive
- end up being very similar to C# version
